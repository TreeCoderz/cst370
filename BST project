1. Download the source programs for Binary Search Tree (BST.cpp, BST.h, and Sample_BST_tester.cpp)
from iLearn.

(a) Change the current search() function to a recursive version.

(b) Add a new member function called inOrder() that implements the inorder traversal algorithm
of a binary search tree. Your function should display each node data on the screen.
void BST::inOrder()

(c) Add a new member function called preOrder() that implements the preorder traversal algorithm
of a binary search tree. Your function should display each node data on the screen.
void BST::preOrder()

(d) Add a new member function called nodeCount() to count the number of nodes in a binary
search tree. In this function, you should use a recursive function. You can’t just use a variable
such as “mySize”.
int BST::nodeCount()

(e) Update the Sample_BST_tester.cpp to show the execution of the functions.
